Vector Editor for Creating PICO-8 Graphics
============

This is a vector editor for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).

PICO-8 is a "fantasy console" game development environment, where all of the sprites for a game have to fit into 128x128 pixels. I wanted to find a way to compress additional graphics that wouldn't take up sprite space.

I used [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) to make this. It's a free, Lua-based game development environment. After downloading this project and LÖVE, simply drag the folder onto the LÖVE application to run it.

There are still more features I want to add and the code needs cleanup, but the basic functionality is there. It copies a compressed string to the clipboard, which can be unpacked in an accompanying PICO-8 cartridge.
